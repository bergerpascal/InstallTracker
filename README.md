# InstallTracker

A PowerShell tool for tracking and analyzing system changes on Windows computers. Creates detailed snapshots of installed programs, services, tasks, registry entries, file systems, and other system components.

## 🎨 Created with Vibe Coding

This entire project was created using **Vibe Coding** - no lines of code were manually written. All development, debugging, and optimization was done using VS Code and AI Agents. This demonstrates the power of modern AI-assisted development workflows.

## 📋 Overview

**InstallTracker** is a configuration management system that documents and analyzes system changes. It enables you to perform "before-and-after" comparisons and quickly identify what changes were made to a system.

## 🎯 Core Applications

### 1. InstallTracker.ps1 (Main Application)

The primary script with a modern graphical user interface for system change tracking:

#### Features:

```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### InstallTracker-Config.json

Automatically created on first settings change save (if nothing is changed and saved the default values are used). Stores your preferences:

```json
{
  "rootPaths": [
    "%USERPROFILE%",
    "%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu",
    "C:\\Program Files",
    "C:\\ProgramData",
    "C:\\Users\\Public\\Desktop",
    "C:\\Program Files (x86)"
  ],
  "scanOptions": {
    "services": true,
    "runKeys": true,
    "uninstallKeys": true,
    "startMenuShortcuts": true,
    "scheduledTasks": true
  },
  "checkVersions": true,
  "gitHubRepository": "bergerpascal/InstallTracker"
}
```

### Supported Environment Variables

The system automatically expands these environment variables:

| Variable | Example Value |
|----------|---------------|
| `%USERPROFILE%` | `C:\Users\Username` |
| `%APPDATA%` | `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming` |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%` | `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local` |
| `%ProgramFiles%` | `C:\Program Files` |
| `%ProgramFiles(x86)%` | `C:\Program Files (x86)` |
| `%ProgramData%` | `C:\ProgramData` |
| `%WINDIR%` | `C:\Windows` |

## 📊 Output Formats

### CSV Format
- Comma-Separated Values
- Compatible with Excel, databases, analysis tools
- Easy to filter and sort
- Human-readable

### JSON Format
- Structured data format
- Ideal for programmatic analysis
- API integration ready
- Long-term archiving
- Deep nesting for complex data

### Text Report
- Human-readable summary
- Organized by change type
- Includes counts and details
- Ready for printing or documentation

## 🔍 How It Works

### PRE Snapshot Process:
1. Scans all configured root paths
2. Recursively reads folders and files (including hidden folders)
3. Queries Windows Services registry
4. Reads Scheduled Tasks
5. Exports Run/RunOnce registry keys
6. Exports Uninstall registry keys
7. Captures all data to CSV and JSON files
8. Saves with timestamp for organization

### POST Snapshot Process:
1. Repeats the scanning process
2. Compares each category against PRE snapshot
3. Identifies added items (not in PRE)
4. Identifies removed items (not in POST)
5. Generates detailed comparison report
6. Shows summary statistics

### Comparison Logic:
- **Added**: Exists in POST but not in PRE
- **Removed**: Exists in PRE but not in POST
- **Unchanged**: Exists in both (not reported)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Execution Policy" Error

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Administrator Rights Required

```powershell
# Open PowerShell with Administrator rights, then:
& "C:\path\to\InstallTracker.ps1"
```

### AppData and Hidden Folders Not Being Scanned

- The script uses `-Force` parameter to include hidden folders
- If you still have issues, try adding explicit paths:
  - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local`
  - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming`

### Reset Configuration

```powershell
Remove-Item "InstallTracker-Config.json"
# Restart script - new config will be created with defaults
```

### Reports Not Generating

- Ensure `_Snapshots` folder is writable
- Check Administrator rights
- Verify sufficient disk space
- Check antivirus isn't blocking file operations

### Key Features Implemented:
- ✅ Full GUI with modern WPF interface
- ✅ Service, Task, Registry, and File scanning
- ✅ Recursive folder traversal with error handling
- ✅ Hidden folder support (AppData, System folders)
- ✅ Before/after comparison and reporting
- ✅ Configuration management via JSON
- ✅ Automatic version checking and updates
- ✅ Comprehensive status and progress reporting
- ✅ CSV and JSON export formats
- ✅ Error recovery and resilience

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Regular Snapshots**: Take PRE snapshots regularly to establish baselines
2. **Clear Documentation**: Always save reports for later reference
3. **Safe Testing**: Use TestData script in controlled environments first
4. **Backup Important Data**: Before making system changes
5. **Run as Admin**: Always run with Administrator privileges
6. **Review Changes**: Always review the report before taking action
